# goat-rulings

This site is meant to streamline the process of looking up a ruling for the Goat format in Yu-Gi-Oh!. Try looking up a ruling on https://www.goatformat.com/ by going to "How to Play" -> "Rules & Policies" -> "Individual Card Rulings", select the appropriate page and find the card you're looking for. Come back here and try the same thing.

Also show results that mention the card, not just rulings specifically for the searched card.
