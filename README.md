# Goat-Rulings

This site is meant to streamline the process of looking up a ruling for Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Goat format. Try finding the rulings for "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" here: https://www.goatformat.com/indivrulings.html.__
Come back and try the same thing.

## Planned features

Also show results that mention the card, not just rulings specifically for the searched card.__
Better formatting for desktop
