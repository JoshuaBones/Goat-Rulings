The most important thing to understand about \u201cLast Turn\u201d is that not all of its effects are applied when the Trap Card resolves. When \u201cLast Turn\u201d (the Trap Card itself) resolves, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards on the field and in both players\u2019 hands are sent to the Graveyard. That is all that happens when \u201cLast Turn\u201d resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of \u201cLast Turn\u201d is applied. \u201cLast Turn\u201d sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like \u201cLast Will\u201d and \u201cChange of Heart\u201d.</li><li>Suppose that \u201cCeasefire\u201d is activated (Chain Link 1), and \u201cLast Turn\u201d is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, \u201cLast Turn\u201d resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of \u201cCeasefire\u201d (Chain Link 1). After \u201cCeasefire\u201d resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of \u201cLast Turn\u201d works: the only thing that happens when \u201cLast Turn\u201d resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.</li><li>\u201cLast Turn\u201d is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d even while \u201cJowgen the Spiritualist\u201d is face-up on the field. If the player activating \u201cLast Turn\u201d controls \u201cJowgen the Spiritualist\u201d and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.</li><li>The special Battle Phase for \u201cLast Turn\u201d happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if \u201cLast Turn\u201d is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.</li><li>The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and select your \u201cThe Rock Spirit\u201d or \u201cSoul of Purity and Light\u201d their effects will be applied during your opponent\u2019s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of \u201cInjection Fairy Lily\u201d and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates \u201cLast Turn\u201d and selects their Defense Position \u201cSpirit Reaper\u201d. The turn player Special Summons \u201cEnraged Battle Ox\u201d and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player\u2019s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of \u201cEnraged Battle Ox\u201d, so the opponent\u2019s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.</li><li>If the Battle Phase is skipped because of \u201cThunder of Ruler\u201d or \u201cSoul Exchange\u201d, resolve the effects of \u201cLast Turn\u201d as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).</li><li>You can chain to the activation of \u201cLast Turn\u201d with cards like \u201cRing of Destruction\u201d, \u201cOfferings to the Doomed\u201d, or \u201cCompulsory Evacuation Device\u201d to eliminate the opponent\u2019s monsters. If the player who activated \u201cLast Turn\u201d has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of \u201cLast Turn\u201d are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.</li><li>The victory check for \u201cLast Turn\u201d is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If your opponent activates \u201cLast Turn\u201d and you Special Summon \u201cDark Magician of Chaos\u201d from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.</li><li>After \u201cLast Turn\u201d sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for \u201cLast Turn\u201d is performed, monster effects like \u201cDespair from the Dark\u201d, \u201cElephant Statue of Disaster\u201d, and \u201cRegenerating Mummy\u201d will activate.</li><li>If \u201cNight Assailant\u201d is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of \u201cLast Turn\u201d, resolve the effect of \u201cNight Assailant\u201d before Special Summoning for \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If your opponent activates \u201cLast Turn\u201d and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like \u201cBig Core\u201d).</li><li>\u201cLast Turn\u201d as a chain to \u201cChange of Heart\u201d: Suppose the turn player activates \u201cChange of Heart\u201d and the opponent chains \u201cLast Turn\u201d, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by \u201cChange of Heart\u201d for \u201cLast Turn\u201d (since it\u2019s still on his side of the field, as \u201cChange of Heart\u201d hasn\u2019t resolved yet). Then \u201cChange of Heart\u201d resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for \u201cLast Turn\u201d. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves \u201cChange of Heart\u201d, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of \u201cLast Turn\u201d before \u201cChange of Heart\u201d, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of \u201cChange of Heart\u201d would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.</li><li>You cannot Special Summon a monster for \u201cLast Turn\u201d that is a \u201cSpecial Summon-only\u201d monster like \u201cChaos Emperor Dragon \u2013 Envoy of the End\u201d, \u201cDark Necrofear\u201d, or \u201cOcean Dragon Lord \u2013 Neo-Daedalus\u201d. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.</li><li>You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, such as \u201cBlue-Eyes White Dragon\u201d or \u201cDark Magician of Chaos\u201d.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and select your face-up \u201cThousand-Eyes Restrict\u201d, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your \u201cThousand-Eyes Restrict\u201d with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.</li><li>While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d in any part of your opponent\u2019s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.</li><li>If \u201cLast Turn\u201d is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up \u201cJowgen the Spiritualist\u201d, your opponent can still retrieve their \u201cSinister Serpent\u201d, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy \u201cJowgen the Spiritualist\u201d in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If \u201cJinzo\u201d is Special Summoned by the effect of \u201cLast Turn\u201d, \u201cJinzo\u201d does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because \u201cLast Turn\u201d has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for \u201cJinzo\u201d to negate.</li><li>If a player\u2019s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of \u201cLast Turn\u201d, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: \u201cGiant Germ\u201d is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of \u201cLast Turn\u201d are still applied.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons \u201cMystic Tomato\u201d for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, and attacks, and \u201cMystic Tomato\u201d is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons \u201cSangan\u201d for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, and \u201cSangan\u201d is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn\u2019t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with \u201cSangan\u201d during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and select your \u201cDark Necrofear\u201d, and it\u2019s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: \u201cDark Necrofear\u201d or \u201cLast Turn\u201d. So you can choose to resolve \u201cDark Necrofear\u201d first, equip it to your opponent\u2019s monster and take control of it, then resolve \u201cLast Turn\u201d and win because only you control a monster.</li><li>Vs. \u201cSanga of the Thunder\u201d, \u201cKazejin\u201d, \u201cSuijin\u201d: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates \u201cLast Turn\u201d selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The monster selected by the player activating \u201cLast Turn\u201d can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons \u201cTwin-Headed Behemoth\u201d and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of \u201cTwin-Headed Behemoth\u201d and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If the effect of \u201cNon Aggression Area\u201d is being applied and you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>\u201cLast Turn\u201d does not target so you can select monsters like \u201cTyrant Dragon\u201d and \u201cFiend Skull Dragon\u201d for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while \u201cKing Dragun\u201d or \u201cLord of D.\u201d is on the field. You can select \u201cSpirit Reaper\u201d and it will not be destroyed by its effect.</li><li>You can activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and select your opponent\u2019s monster that you control with \u201cSnatch Steal\u201d. However, after selecting it, \u201cSnatch Steal\u201d is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for \u201cLast Turn\u201d but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.</li><li>If you activate \u201cLast Turn\u201d and select a monster that was Special Summoned by \u201cCall of the Haunted\u201d, when \u201cCall of the Haunted\u201d is sent to the Graveyard by \u201cLast Turn\u201d, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by \u201cPremature Burial\u201d, the selected monster is not destroyed when \u201cPremature Burial\u201d is sent to the Graveyard by \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If both monsters that battle for \u201cLast Turn\u201d are removed from play (such as with \u201cD.D. Warrior Lady\u201d) then the result is a DRAW.</li><li>If \u201cObnoxious Celtic Guard\u201d battles a monster for \u201cLast Turn\u201d, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.</li><li>\u201cWaboku\u201d can be activated before \u201cLast Turn\u201d, or be chained to the activation of \u201cLast Turn\u201d, and in either case the effect of \u201cWaboku\u201d will prevent the activator\u2019s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.</li><li>If the turn player activated \u201cLast Will\u201d before \u201cLast Turn\u201d was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of \u201cLast Will\u201d during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).</li><li>You can activate \u201cWall of Revealing Light\u201d (paying its cost) and chain \u201cLast Turn\u201d.</li><li>If \u201cPyramid of Light\u201d, \u201cAndro Sphinx\u201d, and \u201cSphinx Teleia\u201d are all sent to the Graveyard by \u201cLast Turn\u201d, \u201cTheinen the Great Sphinx\u201d is not Special Summoned because the effect of \u201cPyramid of Light\u201d activates its effect, but then looks for \u201cAndro Sphinx\u201d and \u201cSphinx Teleia\u201d and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.</li><li>If the battle for \u201cLast Turn\u201d is conducted and the defending monster was \u201cWall of Illusion\u201d, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player\u2019s hand.

The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as \"Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning\" or \"Dark Necrofear\". \"Royal Oppression\" can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of \"Royal Oppression\"\u2019s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card\u2019s effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for \"Horn of Heaven\" or \"Solemn Judgment\").<ul><li>Example 1: If \"Marauding Captain\" is Normal Summoned, its effect activates.

But if your opponent had \"Royal Oppression\" face-up on his side of the field, and you activate the effect of your opponent\u2019s \"Royal Oppression\" to negate the Special Summon of your opponent\u2019s \"Dark Necrofear\", then \"Dark Necrofear\" does not activate its effect in the Graveyard, because it was destroyed by an effect controlled by its owner, not by its owner\u2019s opponent (even though the owner did not activate the effect, he still controls the \"Royal Oppression\" card).</li><li>When \"Vampire Lord\" is Special Summoned by its effect, you can activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" to negate the Special Summon and destroy \"Vampire Lord\".
