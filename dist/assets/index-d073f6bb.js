For example, if "Airknight Parshath" equipped with "Cestus of Dagla" attacks a Defense Position monster, "Airknight Parshath" inflicts damage to the opponent's Life Points during damage calculation. Then, during effect resolution, there are 2 simultaneous Trigger Effects that the controller places in a chain however he likes. If the effect of "Airknight Parshath" is Step 1 and "Cestus of Dagla" is Step 2, the opponent cannot chain "Divine Wrath". However, if "Cestus of Dagla" is Step 1 and "Airknight Parshath" is Step 2, "Divine Wrath" can be chained.

The opponent must declare the activation of “Marauding Captain”’s effect before “Divine Wrath” can be activated. In this case, the monster that would have been Special Summoned remains in the opponent’s hand.</li><li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” during the Damage Step because it is a Counter-Trap, so you may activate it to negate the effect of “D.

The most important thing to understand about “Last Turn” is that not all of its effects are applied when the Trap Card resolves. When “Last Turn” (the Trap Card itself) resolves, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards on the field and in both players’ hands are sent to the Graveyard. That is all that happens when “Last Turn” resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of “Last Turn” is applied. “Last Turn” sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like “Last Will” and “Change of Heart”.</li><li>Suppose that “Ceasefire” is activated (Chain Link 1), and “Last Turn” is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, “Last Turn” resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of “Ceasefire” (Chain Link 1). After “Ceasefire” resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for “Last Turn”, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of “Last Turn” works: the only thing that happens when “Last Turn” resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.</li><li>“Last Turn” is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate “Last Turn” even while “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face-up on the field. If the player activating “Last Turn” controls “Jowgen the Spiritualist” and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for “Last Turn”, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.</li><li>The special Battle Phase for “Last Turn” happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if “Last Turn” is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.</li><li>The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “The Rock Spirit” or “Soul of Purity and Light” their effects will be applied during your opponent’s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily” and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates “Last Turn” and selects their Defense Position “Spirit Reaper”. The turn player Special Summons “Enraged Battle Ox” and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player’s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of “Enraged Battle Ox”, so the opponent’s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.</li><li>If the Battle Phase is skipped because of “Thunder of Ruler” or “Soul Exchange”, resolve the effects of “Last Turn” as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).</li><li>You can chain to the activation of “Last Turn” with cards like “Ring of Destruction”, “Offerings to the Doomed”, or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to eliminate the opponent’s monsters. If the player who activated “Last Turn” has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of “Last Turn” are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.</li><li>The victory check for “Last Turn” is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.</li><li>After “Last Turn” sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for “Last Turn” is performed, monster effects like “Despair from the Dark”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Regenerating Mummy” will activate.</li><li>If “Night Assailant” is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, resolve the effect of “Night Assailant” before Special Summoning for “Last Turn”.</li><li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like “Big Core”).</li><li>“Last Turn” as a chain to “Change of Heart”: Suppose the turn player activates “Change of Heart” and the opponent chains “Last Turn”, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” for “Last Turn” (since it’s still on his side of the field, as “Change of Heart” hasn’t resolved yet). Then “Change of Heart” resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for “Last Turn”. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves “Change of Heart”, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of “Last Turn” before “Change of Heart”, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of “Change of Heart” would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.</li><li>You cannot Special Summon a monster for “Last Turn” that is a “Special Summon-only” monster like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”, “Dark Necrofear”, or “Ocean Dragon Lord – Neo-Daedalus”. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.</li><li>You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for “Last Turn”, such as “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” or “Dark Magician of Chaos”.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your face-up “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.</li><li>While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate “Last Turn” in any part of your opponent’s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.</li><li>If “Last Turn” is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up “Jowgen the Spiritualist”, your opponent can still retrieve their “Sinister Serpent”, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy “Jowgen the Spiritualist” in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Turn”, “Jinzo” does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because “Last Turn” has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for “Jinzo” to negate.</li><li>If a player’s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of “Last Turn”, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: “Giant Germ” is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating “Last Turn”.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of “Last Turn” are still applied.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Mystic Tomato” for “Last Turn”, and attacks, and “Mystic Tomato” is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Sangan” for “Last Turn”, and “Sangan” is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn’t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with “Sangan” during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “Dark Necrofear”, and it’s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: “Dark Necrofear” or “Last Turn”. So you can choose to resolve “Dark Necrofear” first, equip it to your opponent’s monster and take control of it, then resolve “Last Turn” and win because only you control a monster.</li><li>Vs. “Sanga of the Thunder”, “Kazejin”, “Suijin”: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for “Last Turn”, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates “Last Turn” selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The monster selected by the player activating “Last Turn” can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If the effect of “Non Aggression Area” is being applied and you activate “Last Turn”, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for “Last Turn”.</li><li>“Last Turn” does not target so you can select monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” and “Fiend Skull Dragon” for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field. You can select “Spirit Reaper” and it will not be destroyed by its effect.</li><li>You can activate “Last Turn” and select your opponent’s monster that you control with “Snatch Steal”. However, after selecting it, “Snatch Steal” is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for “Last Turn” but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select a monster that was Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted”, when “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial”, the selected monster is not destroyed when “Premature Burial” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”.</li><li>If both monsters that battle for “Last Turn” are removed from play (such as with “D.D. Warrior Lady”) then the result is a DRAW.</li><li>If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” battles a monster for “Last Turn”, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.</li><li>“Waboku” can be activated before “Last Turn”, or be chained to the activation of “Last Turn”, and in either case the effect of “Waboku” will prevent the activator’s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.</li><li>If the turn player activated “Last Will” before “Last Turn” was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Will” during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).</li><li>You can activate “Wall of Revealing Light” (paying its cost) and chain “Last Turn”.</li><li>If “Pyramid of Light”, “Andro Sphinx”, and “Sphinx Teleia” are all sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is not Special Summoned because the effect of “Pyramid of Light” activates its effect, but then looks for “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.</li><li>If the battle for “Last Turn” is conducted and the defending monster was “Wall of Illusion”, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player’s hand. The turn player can then Normal Summon the monster in the Main Phase (unless it has passed).</li></ul>","LAST WILL":`Card Errata:<ul><li><font color="#818181">You can only use this card's effect once, and only during this turn.

If the opponent Summons "X-Head Cannon" (1800 ATK / LIGHT), “Luminous Spark” will raise the ATK of “X-Head Cannon” to 2300, making it the highest ATK monster on the field, so it’s unaffected by Spell Cards, so it drops to 1800 ATK, then increases to 2300, then drops to 1800, etc. This would create an infinite loop. Therefore, the opponent cannot Summon “X-Head Cannon”. </li><li>EXAMPLE #2: The opponent has "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000 ATK) and “Pole Position” face-up on the field. I have "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK), and an "Opticlops" (1800 ATK) equipped with "Axe of Despair"(+1000 ATK; 2800 total) face-up on the field, and a Set "Ring of Destruction". If I activate "Ring of Destruction" to destroy "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", then “Opticlops” will be the highest ATK monster on the field, and cause an infinite loop (it is the highest, it isn’t, it is, it isn’t, etc.). Therefore, I cannot target “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” with “Ring of Destruction”. </li><li>EXAMPLE #3: The opponent has a face-down "Pole Position". I have "Opticlops" (1800 ATK) and "Gemini Elf" (1900 ATK) face-up on the field. I activate "Axe of Despair" (+1000 ATK) and try to equip my "Opticlops" (1800 ATK). The opponent cannot chain "Pole Position", since that would cause an infinite loop. “Pole Position” is an illegal activation.

If I Set 1 of the 2 cards in my hand, “Blade Knight” gains +400 ATK with its effect, becomes the highest-ATK monster, and because of “Luminous Spark” an infinite loop is created. So I am not allowed to Set a card. </li></ul></li><li>If an infinite loop is caused because of game mechanics and not by a player’s voluntary card play, “Pole Position” will be destroyed.

The opponent has a "Muka Muka" equipped with "Axe of Despair" face-up on the field with no cards in his hand. At the start of the opponent's turn, he draws a card, making "Muka Muka"s ATK 1900.

The turn player has “Robbin’ Goblin”, “Pole Position”, and “Giant Orc” (2200 ATK). The turn player attacks “Marauding Captain” with “Giant Orc”, inflicting 1000 points of damage. The opponent has to discard a card because of “Robbin’ Goblin” and an infinite loop is created because “Blade Knight” now fluctuates between 2300 and 2000 ATK (either above or below “Giant Orc”, making it the strongest monster on the field… or not). Therefore, “Pole Position” is destroyed.</li><li>EXAMPLE #7: I have "Pole Position", "Banner of Courage", and "Opticlops" face-up on the field. The opponent has "Gemini Elf" face-up on the field. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK.

The opponent attacks my face-down "Opticlops" with "Mokey Mokey". When we flip "Opticlops" face-up in the Damage Step, an infinite loop is created as “Opticlops” fluctuates between 1800 and 2300 ATK (either above or below “Gemini Elf”, making it the strongest monster on the field, or not).

The first way is with a Spell Card like "Monster Reborn", a Trap Card like "Call of the Haunted", or an Effect Monster like "Magical Scientist". The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning" or "Dark Necrofear". "Royal Oppression" can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of "Royal Oppression"’s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card’s effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for "Horn of Heaven" or "Solemn Judgment").<ul><li>Example 1: If "Marauding Captain" is Normal Summoned, its effect activates. You can chain to this effect by activating the effect of "Royal Oppression". The effect of "Marauding Captain" is negated, no monster is Special Summoned, and the "Marauding Captain" is destroyed. (The monster your opponent intended to Special Summon with the effect of "Marauding Captain" remains in his hand.)</li><li>Example 2: If "Cyber Jar" is Flip Summoned and its Flip Effect activates, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain to the Flip Effect. The effect of "Cyber Jar" is negated, no monsters on the field are destroyed by its effect, no cards are picked up, no monsters are Special Summoned, and "Cyber Jar" is destroyed by the effect of "Royal Oppression".</li><li>Example 3: If "Call of the Haunted" is activated, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain. The effect of "Call of the Haunted" is negated, and a monster is not Special Summoned.</li></ul></li><li>The effects of face-up Trap Cards cannot be activated during the Damage Step, so this card’s effect cannot negate the Special Summoning of a monster by the effect of “Mystic Tomato” or a “Cyber Jar” flipped face-up by an attack.</li><li>You can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" as a chain to "Monster Gate". No cards will be picked up, and no monster will be Special Summoned (The opponent still must have Tributed a monster as a cost).</li><li>You can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate an effect that Summons 1 monster, or Summons multiple monsters (like "Cyber Jar", "The Shallow Grave", or "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior").</li><li>If "Royal Oppression" is face-up on the field, and "Monster Reborn" is activated to Special Summon "Jinzo", you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in a chain to negate the Special Summon because "Jinzo" is not on the field until the chain resolves.</li><li>If you have "Royal Oppression" face-up on your side of the field, and your opponent attempts to Special Summon "Dark Necrofear", and you activate the effect of your "Royal Oppression", then "Dark Necrofear" will activate its effect in the Graveyard and return to the field as an Equip Spell Card. But if your opponent had "Royal Oppression" face-up on his side of the field, and you activate the effect of your opponent’s "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon of your opponent’s "Dark Necrofear", then "Dark Necrofear" does not activate its effect in the Graveyard, because it was destroyed by an effect controlled by its owner, not by its owner’s opponent (even though the owner did not activate the effect, he still controls the "Royal Oppression" card).</li><li>When "Vampire Lord" is Special Summoned by its effect, you can activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Vampire Lord". If your "Vampire Lord" is destroyed in this way by the effect of a "Royal Oppression" card controlled by your opponent, then "Vampire Lord" was destroyed by a card controlled by your opponent, and is Special Summoned during your next Standby Phase.</li><li>When "Insect Queen" destroys your opponent’s monster, an "Insect Monster Token" is Special Summoned during the End Phase, and the effect of "Royal Oppression" can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Insect Queen".</li><li>When "Jam Breeding Machine" activates its effect to Special Summon a "Slime Token" in the Standby Phase, and the effect of "Royal Oppression" can be activated at that time to negate the Special Summon and destroy "Jam Breeding Machine".</li><li>If the effect of "Royal Oppression" is activated, and "Mystical Space Typhoon" or "Dust Tornado" is chained to destroy "Royal Oppression", then the effect of "Royal Oppression" disappears because it is a Continuous Trap Card, and the Special Summon will not be negated.</li><li>Remember that "Royal Oppression" follows the rules of all Continuous Trap Cards. In order to chain the effect of "Royal Oppression" to a card effect, "Royal Oppression" must have already been face-up on the field. For example, if "Monster Reborn" is activated, you cannot flip "Royal Oppression" face-up and activate the effect of "Royal Oppression" in the same chain.</li></ul>',"ROYAL TRIBUTE":'Individual Card FAQs:<ul><li>Both players must show their hands to the opponent when "Royal Tribute" resolves.</li><li>If you activate "Royal Tribute" and your opponent chains "Mystical Space Typhoon" to destroy "Necrovalley", the effect of "Royal Tribute" still resolves.</li></ul>',"RYU-KISHIN CLOWN":"Netrep Rulings:<ul><li><span>If “Final Attack Orders” is active when “Ryu-Kishin Clown’s” effect triggers, </span><span>the targeted monster will switch to Defense Position and then immediately change to Attack Position.</span></li></ul>","RYU KOKKI":`Individual Card FAQs:<ul><li>If "Ryu Kokki" battles with "Dark Magician of Chaos", "Ryu Kokki" is destroyed and removed from play by "Dark Magician of Chaos"' effect, and "Dark Magician of Chaos" is removed from play because it is destroyed by "Ryu Kokki"'s effect and removed by its own effect.</li></ul>`,"RYU SENSHI":'Individual Card FAQs:<ul><li>This card’s effect that negates Spell Cards that target it is not optional.</li><li>You can Special Summon this card from the Graveyard with "Monster Reborn" because its effect that negates Spell Cards is not active while it is in the Graveyard (but only if was properly Fusion Summoned originally).</li><li>A Spell Card that targets this card may be activated, but it will be negated and destroyed.</li><li>The effect of this card will not negate "Creature Swap", "Fissure", "Smashing Ground", "Dark Hole", "Raigeki", or similar cards that do not target.</li><li>If you try to equip "Fusion Sword Murasame Blade" to this monster, it will be negated and destroyed.</li></ul>Netrep Rulings:<ul><li><span>“Ryu Senshi” may only negate the effect of a Normal Trap Card. </span></li><li><span>“Ryu Senshi” cannot negate the effect of a Continuous Trap Card or a Counter Trap Card.</span></li></ul>',"​SACRED CRANE":'Netrep Rulings:<ul><li>The effect of "Sacred Crane" does not activate if it is Special Summoned face-down.</li></ul>',"SACRED PHOENIX OF NEPHTHYS":'Individual Card FAQs:<ul><li>You can activate “Divine Wrath” when “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned by its own effect. Because this effect activates in the Graveyard, and is being negated while "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is in the Graveyard, "Sacred Phoenix of Nepthys" is never Special Summoned (so the card is never moved from the Graveyard) and is never destroyed. Because it is not destroyed, its effect to Special Summon itself does not activate again.</li><li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is Special Summoned with “Call of the Haunted” or “Premature Burial”, and that card is destroyed and destroys “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” with its effect, you Special Summon “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” during your next Standby Phase because it was destroyed by a card effect.</li><li>If “Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys” is destroyed while in your hand or Deck by a card effect, you still activate its effect during your next Standby Phase to Special Summon it from the Graveyard.

When “Last Resort” resolves, the Field Spell Card in your Field Spell Card Zone is destroyed and “Ancient City – Rainbow Ruins” is placed into your Field Spell Card Zone.</li></ul>","LAST TURN":"<ul><li>“Last Turn” is a very special Trap Card with very special and unusual rules. The most important thing to understand about “Last Turn” is that not all of its effects are applied when the Trap Card resolves. When “Last Turn” (the Trap Card itself) resolves, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards on the field and in both players’ hands are sent to the Graveyard. That is all that happens when “Last Turn” resolves. After that, the turn player Special Summons 1 monster from their Deck. After that, a special Battle Phase occurs. Then, during the End Phase, the victory check of “Last Turn” is applied. “Last Turn” sets up several effects that resolve later in the turn long after the Trap Card itself has resolved. Several other cards do this too, like “Last Will” and “Change of Heart”.</li><li>Suppose that “Ceasefire” is activated (Chain Link 1), and “Last Turn” is chained to it (Chain Link 2). In this case, “Last Turn” resolves first, the activating player selects 1 monster on their side of the field, and all other cards are sent to the Graveyard. Then resolve the effect of “Ceasefire” (Chain Link 1). After “Ceasefire” resolves, the turn player Special Summons a monster for “Last Turn”, then the special Battle Phase occurs, then in the End Phase the victory check is applied. This is an example of how the special nature of “Last Turn” works: the only thing that happens when “Last Turn” resolves is to select 1 monster and send all other cards to the Graveyard.</li><li>“Last Turn” is not a card that Special Summons a monster when it resolves. Therefore you can activate “Last Turn” even while “Jowgen the Spiritualist” is face-up on the field. If the player activating “Last Turn” controls “Jowgen the Spiritualist” and selects it as the monster to keep, the opponent cannot Special Summon for “Last Turn”, and there will be no special Battle Phase. However the victory check is still applied in the End Phase.</li><li>The special Battle Phase for “Last Turn” happens right after the monster is Special Summoned. It is in addition to the normal Battle Phase and does not disrupt the normal order of the turn. For example, if “Last Turn” is activated during the Draw Phase, resolves the effect, Special Summon, initiate the special Battle Phase, then continue with the Draw Phase. The turn player can have a normal Battle Phase later in the turn.</li><li>The special Battle Phase is treated like a standard Battle Phase in every other way, with a Start Step, Battle Step, Damage Step, and End Step. Only the selected monster and the Special Summoned monster can battle.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “The Rock Spirit” or “Soul of Purity and Light” their effects will be applied during your opponent’s special Battle Phase. Also any Flip Effects are resolved as normal, etc. You can use the effect of “Injection Fairy Lily” and other monster effects during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The effect that reduces Battle Damage to zero applies only for the special Battle Phase, not for the normal Battle Phase. Example: A player activates “Last Turn” and selects their Defense Position “Spirit Reaper”. The turn player Special Summons “Enraged Battle Ox” and attacks in the special Battle Phase, but no damage occurs. However, during the turn player’s normal Battle Phase they can attack again, and will inflict 1500 points of damage due to the effect of “Enraged Battle Ox”, so the opponent’s Life Points will be zero and the turn player will win.</li><li>If the Battle Phase is skipped because of “Thunder of Ruler” or “Soul Exchange”, resolve the effects of “Last Turn” as much as possible (including victory check, quite possibly resulting in a DRAW).</li><li>You can chain to the activation of “Last Turn” with cards like “Ring of Destruction”, “Offerings to the Doomed”, or “Compulsory Evacuation Device” to eliminate the opponent’s monsters. If the player who activated “Last Turn” has no monsters on the field when it resolves, the effects of “Last Turn” are not negated. So the turn player still Special Summons a monster, although the special Battle Phase is not conducted, but the victory check in the End Phase is still performed.</li><li>The victory check for “Last Turn” is an effect that must be resolved by the player who activated it. The turn player still has priority to activate and resolve any other effects first. You cannot chain to the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon “Dark Magician of Chaos” from your Deck, you can activate his effect to add a Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand.</li><li>After “Last Turn” sends all cards to the Graveyard, before the Special Summon for “Last Turn” is performed, monster effects like “Despair from the Dark”, “Elephant Statue of Disaster”, and “Regenerating Mummy” will activate.</li><li>If “Night Assailant” is sent from the hand to the Graveyard by the effect of “Last Turn”, resolve the effect of “Night Assailant” before Special Summoning for “Last Turn”.</li><li>If your opponent activates “Last Turn” and you Special Summon a monster that can attack twice, it can attack twice during the special Battle Phase (important if the opponent had a monster like “Big Core”).</li><li>“Last Turn” as a chain to “Change of Heart”: Suppose the turn player activates “Change of Heart” and the opponent chains “Last Turn”, then the opponent selects the monster targeted by “Change of Heart” for “Last Turn” (since it’s still on his side of the field, as “Change of Heart” hasn’t resolved yet). Then “Change of Heart” resolves and the turn player gains control of the monster, then Special Summons for “Last Turn”. There is no special Battle Phase. Assuming that the opponent somehow survives the standard Battle Phase, during the End Phase, the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect. If the turn player activates and resolves “Change of Heart”, then the monster goes back to the opponent and (assuming nothing else has happened), both players each have 1 monster and the result is a DRAW. If the turn player passes priority to the opponent, the opponent can activate and resolve the effect of “Last Turn” before “Change of Heart”, and in this case the turn player still has 2 monsters and the opponent has zero, so the turn player would win. If the turn player passed priority to the opponent and the opponent passes it back, the turn player MUST activate and resolve an effect, so the effect of “Change of Heart” would expire and both players would have 1 monster each, resulting in a DRAW.</li><li>You cannot Special Summon a monster for “Last Turn” that is a “Special Summon-only” monster like “Chaos Emperor Dragon – Envoy of the End”, “Dark Necrofear”, or “Ocean Dragon Lord – Neo-Daedalus”. Nor can you select a Spirit Monster because they cannot be Special Summoned.</li><li>You CAN Special Summon a high-level monster that has no Special Summoning restrictions for “Last Turn”, such as “Blue-Eyes White Dragon” or “Dark Magician of Chaos”.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your face-up “Thousand-Eyes Restrict”, the turn player cannot attack so unless they can destroy your “Thousand-Eyes Restrict” with a card effect, each of you will have a monster during the End Phase and the Duel will end in a DRAW.</li><li>While your Life Points are 1000 or less, you can activate “Last Turn” in any part of your opponent’s turn, except the Damage Step. You can even activate it during the End Phase.</li><li>If “Last Turn” is activated and the turn player has no monsters to Summon, there is no battle however the victory check is still applied.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” during the Draw Phase or Standby Phase, and select your face-up “Jowgen the Spiritualist”, your opponent can still retrieve their “Sinister Serpent”, Summon it normally in Main Phase 1, and attack and destroy “Jowgen the Spiritualist” in the normal Battle Phase, then win the Duel in the End Phase because of the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If “Jinzo” is Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Turn”, “Jinzo” does not negate the special Battle Phase or victory check because “Last Turn” has already resolved and been sent to the Graveyard, so it is no longer on the field for “Jinzo” to negate.</li><li>If a player’s Life Points are reduced to zero during the special Battle Phase of “Last Turn”, or afterwards during the normal course of the turn, then that player loses. Example: “Giant Germ” is Special Summoned by the turn player and is destroyed as a result of battle, and the opponent had 500 or fewer Life Points when activating “Last Turn”.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and then your Life Points increase above 1000 later, the effects of “Last Turn” are still applied.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Mystic Tomato” for “Last Turn”, and attacks, and “Mystic Tomato” is destroyed, its effect activates and a monster is Special Summoned, but that new monster cannot attack during the special Battle Phase. (But it can attack during the standard Battle Phase.)</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Sangan” for “Last Turn”, and “Sangan” is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, then its effect is resolved. If the turn player hasn’t Normal Summoned a monster that turn, they can Summon the monster retrieved with “Sangan” during their Main Phase (and attack during their standard Battle Phase). This can result in a DRAW.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select your “Dark Necrofear”, and it’s destroyed during the special Battle Phase, you can select which effect resolves first during the End Phase: “Dark Necrofear” or “Last Turn”. So you can choose to resolve “Dark Necrofear” first, equip it to your opponent’s monster and take control of it, then resolve “Last Turn” and win because only you control a monster.</li><li>Vs. “Sanga of the Thunder”, “Kazejin”, “Suijin”: If the turn player Special Summons any of these monsters for “Last Turn”, he cannot activate the effect. However, if the player who activates “Last Turn” selects one of these monsters, he can activate the effect during the special Battle Phase.</li><li>The monster selected by the player activating “Last Turn” can be face-up or face-down, in Attack or Defense Position.</li><li>If the turn player Special Summons “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and it is destroyed during the special Battle Phase, during the End Phase the turn player has priority to activate and resolve an effect first, so he can choose the effect of “Twin-Headed Behemoth” and Special Summon it to the field before the victory check of “Last Turn”.</li><li>If the effect of “Non Aggression Area” is being applied and you activate “Last Turn”, your opponent does not Special Summon from the Deck for “Last Turn”.</li><li>“Last Turn” does not target so you can select monsters like “Tyrant Dragon” and “Fiend Skull Dragon” for its effect, or a Dragon-Type monster while “King Dragun” or “Lord of D.” is on the field. You can select “Spirit Reaper” and it will not be destroyed by its effect.</li><li>You can activate “Last Turn” and select your opponent’s monster that you control with “Snatch Steal”. However, after selecting it, “Snatch Steal” is sent to the Graveyard so control of the monster returns to the turn player. The turn player then Special Summons for “Last Turn” but no special Battle Phase is conducted. The victory check is still conducted in the End Phase.</li><li>If you activate “Last Turn” and select a monster that was Special Summoned by “Call of the Haunted”, when “Call of the Haunted” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, your selected monster is destroyed. But if you selected a monster Special Summoned by “Premature Burial”, the selected monster is not destroyed when “Premature Burial” is sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”.</li><li>If both monsters that battle for “Last Turn” are removed from play (such as with “D.D. Warrior Lady”) then the result is a DRAW.</li><li>If “Obnoxious Celtic Guard” battles a monster for “Last Turn”, its effect is applied and it is not destroyed if it battles a monster with 1900 or higher ATK.</li><li>“Waboku” can be activated before “Last Turn”, or be chained to the activation of “Last Turn”, and in either case the effect of “Waboku” will prevent the activator’s monster from being destroyed. This can lead to a DRAW.</li><li>If the turn player activated “Last Will” before “Last Turn” was activated, a monster can be Special Summoned by the effect of “Last Will” during the special Battle Phase (but it cannot attack during the special Battle Phase).</li><li>You can activate “Wall of Revealing Light” (paying its cost) and chain “Last Turn”.</li><li>If “Pyramid of Light”, “Andro Sphinx”, and “Sphinx Teleia” are all sent to the Graveyard by “Last Turn”, “Theinen the Great Sphinx” is not Special Summoned because the effect of “Pyramid of Light” activates its effect, but then looks for “Andro Sphinx” and “Sphinx Teleia” and does not find them on the field, so it cannot destroy them with its effect.</li><li>If the battle for “Last Turn” is conducted and the defending monster was “Wall of Illusion”, but it is destroyed, the attacking monster is returned to the turn player’s hand. The turn player can then Normal Summon the monster in the Main Phase (unless it has passed).</li></ul>","LAST WILL":`<ul><li>You can activate “Last Will” before or after a monster is sent to the Graveyard, and still get the effect of “Last Will” to Special Summon a monster.</li><li>You can choose the timing for when you Special Summon for the effect of “Last Will”. You can Special Summon the monster at any time during your turn, except during damage calculation. You do not have to Special Summon the monster at the point the first monster was sent to the Graveyard. If you activated “Last Will” after a monster was sent to the Graveyard, you do not have to Special Summon the monster when “Last Will” resolves.</li><li>If you wish, you may Special Summon the monster immediately after “Last Will” resolves (if activated after a monster was destroyed), or when the first monster is sent to the Graveyard (if “Last Will” was activated before the monster was destroyed). But you don’t have to, you can do it later.</li><li>For example, if your monster is destroyed by battle, and you activate “Last Will” during Main Phase 2, you can Special Summon a monster at that time. Or you can wait and Special Summon during the End Phase.</li><li>You can apply the effect of “Last Will” as long as a monster on your side of the field is (or was) sent to your Graveyard, no matter which Phase it was in. As long as it’s the same turn in which you activated “Last Will”.</li><li>If you activate 2 "Last Wills", then you get to Special Summon 2 monsters, as long as a monster is (or was) sent from your side of the field to your Graveyard that same turn.</li><li>You only Special Summon 1 monster for each 1 "Last Will".</li><li>If you Special Summon using "Last Will’s" effect, then you don’t get to Special Summon for it again (but you do for any other copies of “Last Will” that are activated). If you activate “Last Will”, and the end of the turn arrives without using "Last Will’s" effect, then the effect is gone.</li><li>You can Special Summon for “Last Will” if a monster was Tributed for a Tribute Summon, or for "Cannon Soldier’s" effect, etc.</li><li>You can use "Last Will’s" effect to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher monster like "Labyrinth Wall".</li><li>You cannot Special Summon a "Special Summon-only" monster.</li><li>"Last Will’s" effect can only be used if your OWN monster is (or was) sent from YOUR side of the field to YOUR Graveyard.</li><li>If your monster is sent to your Graveyard by battle, you resolve "Last Will’s" effect during that same Battle Phase (but not during the Damage Step). If it’s your turn, then your newly Summoned monster can attack before Main Phase 2.</li><li>If "Imperial Order" is activated after "Last Will" has resolved, it will not negate "Last Will's" effect.</li><li>You can Special Summon a 1500 ATK monster that will have higher than 1500 ATK after being Summoned, such as a Fiend with 1500 original ATK while "Yami" is on the field (its ATK once Summoned will be 1700). You can Special Summon "Muka Muka" even if you have 6 cards in your hand and "Muka Muka's" ATK, once Summoned, will be higher than 1500.</li></ul>`,"LAVA GOLEM":`<em>This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set.

It is also NOT applied when cards in your hand are removed from play by the effect of "Lightforce Sword".</li><li>The effect of "Magical Thorn" is only applied when a card is discarded from your opponent’s hand to your opponent’s Graveyard. So if they have your card in your hand by the effect of "Exchange" or "Graverobber" and they discard it, they do not take any damage from the effect of "Magical Thorn".</li><li>If the opponent discards from their hand as a cost to activate a card like "Cost Down" and you chain "Magical Thorn" they will not take any damage. If your opponent activates a card where discarding is part of the effect of the card, such as "Card Destruction", and you chain "Magical Thorn", they WILL take damage because the effect of "Magical Thorn" will be active before the discarding effect resolves.</li><li>"Magical Thorn" deals damage per card, so if the opponent activates "Graceful Charity" they will take 1000 points of damage when they discard 2 cards.

So if the effect of "Morphing Jar" is activated, the damage will be dealt after the new cards are drawn. This means if your opponent has 100 Life Points, and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field but only one card left in your Deck, you will lose the Duel before the effect of "Magical Thorn" can deal damage to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.</li><li>"Magical Thorn" will deal damage between steps in a chain. For example, both you and your opponent have 100 Life Points remaining, your opponent has two cards in their hand and you have "Magical Thorn" active on the field and a Set "Mind Crush". It is your opponent’s turn and they activate "Final Flame" to deal 600 points of damage to you, and you chain "Mind Crush" calling the "Sinister Serpent" you know they have in their hand. After Step 2 ("Mind Crush") resolves, the effect of "Magical Thorn" deals 500 points of damage to your opponent and you win the Duel before Step 1, "Final Flame", resolves.</li></ul>',MAGICAT:Dd,MAHARAGHI:Ad,"MAIDEN OF THE AQUA":'<ul><li>The effect of "Maiden of the Aqua" is active only when there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field.

So you activate its effect, and do not discard. Then you can choose not to pay 700 Life Points to keep "Imperial Order", and "Imperial Order" will be destroyed. Then you can enter Main Phase 1, and you did not have to discard for "Mirage of Nightmare" (because its effect was negated at the time you chose to resolve it).</li><li>When the turn player controls "Imperial Order" and the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare":</li><li>If the opponent controls "Mirage of Nightmare" going into the turn player’s Standby Phase, and the turn player already controls a face-up "Imperial Order", then there are 2 mandatory effects that must be resolved: the turn player must pay 700 Life Points or destroy "Imperial Order", and the opponent must draw cards for "Mirage of Nightmare". The turn player has priority to resolve an effect first. If the turn player passes, priority goes to the opponent. If the opponent also passes, then the turn player must resolve an effect, and must pay for "Imperial Order" or it is destroyed. If he does not pay, and "Imperial Order" is destroyed, then the opponent can draw for "Mirage of Nightmare".</li><li>The same procedure is used if both players control "Mirage of Nightmare".

If you draw so that you have 4 cards using 1 "Mirage of Nightmare", and some effect causes you to discard during that same Standby Phase, you may then activate the other "Mirage of Nightmare" to draw back up to 4; in this case you discard separately for each "Mirage of Nightmare" because you drew with both, and if 1 of them is destroyed you do not have to discard for its effect, only for the effect of the "Mirage of Nightmare" that was not destroyed.</li><li>If you have 4 or more cards in your hand during your opponent’s Standby Phase, do not draw, and do not discard during your next Standby Phase (the effect of "Mirage of Nightmare" is not applied).</li><li>If your Standby Phase is skipped because of "Solomon’s Lawbook", etc., do not discard for "Mirage of Nightmare".</li><li>Drawing for "Mirage of Nightmare" is considered 1 draw no matter how many cards are drawn, so you only gain 500 Life Points if you have "Solemn Wishes".</li><li>If you draw 3 cards for "Mirage of Nightmare", but only have 2 cards in your hand during your next Standby Phase, discard your entire hand (2 cards).</li></ul>',"MIRROR GATE":`<ul><li>This card does not target.</li><li>If your "Elemental Hero" monster is in Defense Position, calculate damage as normal, using its DEF.</li><li>If you activate "Mirror Gate", Damage Calculation is resolved as part of the resolution of "Mirror Gate's" effect.
